# Character editor for Diablo Belzebub mod
Very simple editor. You can _not_ get unique items or create new items. You can only modify attributes on equiped items.
* Sometimes it will not work and the file will get corrupted. You can try different values or put the attribute to different item.
* Most of the things works without problems.
* Typical value ranges "-125 - -1" "-125 - 125" "1 - 125" "1 - 250" "1 - 32000"
* Unique and set items are very safe (different structure in the file)
* Make sure to backup all files including shared box! When the character file is corrupted, shared box will be wiped out too.
