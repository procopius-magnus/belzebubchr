# Character editor for Diablo Belzebub mod
Very simple editor. You can _not_ get unique items or create new items. You can only modify attributes on equiped items.
Sometimes it will not work and the file will get corrupted. You can try different values or put the attribute to different item.
Most of the things works without problems.
